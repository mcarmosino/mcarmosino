					<h2>ABOUT</h2>
					<p>
                        I am currently a senior at Vanderbilt University studying Human and Organizational Development
                        with a minor in Data Science. I am a constant learner and listner. I enjoy learning about many different topics,
                        like the interactions between humans and the biosphere and how they affect one another to the differing effectiveness of public transportation between cities. My drive as an
                        active listner and learner has propelled me into a career of Data Science. The process of carefully wrangling data then conducting anaylses to make
                        an informed, educated, and confident decision align with my personality.
